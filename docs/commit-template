<type>[optional scope]: <description>

# Provide a short summary of the change, using imperative mood. Keep it
# under 50 characters. Example: feat(parser): add new error handler

[optional body]

# If necessary, provide a longer explanation of the change. Explain *what*
# was done and *why* it was done. Keep each line of the body under 72 
# characters. Leave one blank line between the description and body.
# Example:
#
# The new error handler improves parser accuracy in handling nested
# arrays. This resolves issues related to memory leaks in the previous
# implementation.
#
# This also includes minor refactoring for better code readability.

[optional footer(s)]

# One or more footers may be added here. Each footer should start one blank
# line after the body and follow the format: <token>: <description>.
# Example footers:
#
# BREAKING CHANGE: refactor array handling logic in parser module.
